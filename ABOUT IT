Overview

This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based system for detecting phishing emails using TF-IDF feature extraction and Logistic Regression classification.
The project demonstrates how mathematical modeling and text analytics can be combined to automate phishing detection efficiently.
Developed as part of a Cybersecurity Capstone Project, this research aims to advance AI-driven threat intelligence and provide a transparent, reproducible foundation for future academic work.

Objectives

Detect phishing emails using text-based analysis instead of rule-based filtering.

Apply TF-IDF vectorization to represent textual data numerically.

Train a Logistic Regression classifier for binary prediction (phishing vs. legitimate).

Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.

Generate automated sample datasets for demonstration and validation.
